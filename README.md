# AIContextOptimizer
**Multi-LLM Context Summarization &amp; Efficiency Platform to reduce token usage, benchmark AI models, and optimize AI interactions.**

---

## Overview
AIContextOptimizer is a research-focused platform designed to **reduce token usage and improve efficiency** when interacting with multiple large language models (LLMs). It intelligently summarizes conversation context, enabling developers and researchers to benchmark multiple AI models while minimizing cost, latency, and infrastructure overhead.

---

## Real-World Use Case
Large enterprises often use AI-powered systems for customer support, knowledge management, and internal automation. Each AI interaction may involve sending long conversation histories, leading to **massive token consumption and escalating costs**, especially when multiple AI providers are used.

**AIContextOptimizer addresses this by:**
- **Context Summarization:** Compresses conversation histories while retaining key information, reducing token usage by 50–80%.  
- **Multi-LLM Optimization:** Routes requests to the most cost-efficient AI model without compromising quality.  
- **Efficiency Tracking:** Monitors tokens, cost, and latency to provide actionable insights.

**Impact Example:**  
- Enterprise with 10 million interactions/month at 2,000 tokens per interaction:  
  - **Current cost:** $600,000/month  
  - **With AIContextOptimizer (70% token reduction):** $180,000/month  
  - **Monthly savings:** $420,000 → Annual savings: ~$5 million  

> Scaled across multiple clients, regions, or billions of queries, savings can reach **tens or hundreds of millions of dollars annually**.

## Goals / Success Criteria
- Working multi-LLM adapter to call multiple AI providers.  
- Summarization layer to compress conversation context.  
- Dashboard showing efficiency metrics (tokens used, cost, latency).  
- Ability to compare outputs from multiple AI models.

## Core Features / MVP
1. Chat interface built with **Next.js + TypeScript**.  
2. FastAPI backend to receive messages and route requests.  
3. Adapter layer supporting at least 2 AI models (OpenAI + one free/mocked model).  
4. Basic context summarization layer.  
5. Token and cost tracking for each AI call.  
6. Simple dashboard to visualize responses and metrics.

## Development Notes / TODOs
1. Setup Next.js frontend with chat UI.  
2. Setup FastAPI backend with simple endpoint.  
3. Implement adapter for one AI model.  
4. Add summarization layer for conversation context.  
5. Track token usage and cost metrics.  
6. Build dashboard to display responses and efficiency metrics.
